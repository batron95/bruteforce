Key Changes:
1. Dynamic Input:

	The target URL and password file are now passed as command-line arguments.
	You can specify any URL and password list at runtime.

2. Usage Check: If the correct number of arguments isnâ€™t provided, the script will show usage instructions and exit.

3. More User-Friendly Output: The script prints the target URL and password file being used for easy tracking.
